Enhancing Student Employability in Collaboration with the Industry: Case Study of a Partnership with Amazon Web Services Academy - Review of Related Literature Report
 
This report examines the article's Review of Related Literature (RRL) focusing on enhancing student employability through industry collaboration, particularly with the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Academy. It summarizes key points, analyzes relevance, synthesizes insights, and identifies gaps for further study.
 
1. Summarizing Key Points:
 
The RRL draws upon a range of existing literature, encompassing:
 
- Employability Skills Gaps: Studies highlighting the disconnect between academic skills and industry demands, particularly focusing on the tech sector and cloud computing skills.
- Industry-Academia Partnerships: Research exploring successful models of collaboration between universities and companies, including the identification of key success factors like curriculum alignment and industry mentorship.
- AWS Academy Programs: Existing literature on the AWS Academy program itself, including official documentation, AWS-published case studies, and independent evaluations of the program's effectiveness in equipping students with relevant skills.
- Technology's Impact on Employability: Studies analyzing the impact of specific technologies like cloud computing on the job market and the skills needed to succeed in those fields.
 
2. Analyzing Relevance to Research Topic:
 
The RRL is highly relevant to the research topic, informing key aspects:
 
- Problem Definition:  The RRL establishes the existing gap between the skills graduates possess and the skills employers require, justifying the need for industry-academia partnerships like the AWS Academy initiative.
- Theoretical Framework: The literature on successful industry-academia partnerships provides a framework for understanding the factors that contribute to the success or failure of such collaborations. This framework guides the case study's analysis of the AWS Academy partnership.
- Benchmarking:  The literature on the AWS Academy program and similar initiatives provides benchmarks against which to compare the specific case study, allowing for a more nuanced and comparative analysis of the program's effectiveness.
- Key Variable Identification: The literature identifies key variables to consider in the case study, such as curriculum design, instructor training, student engagement, and employer feedback.
 
3. Synthesized Insights and Identified Gaps:
 
Synthesizing the literature reveals several potential gaps:
 
- Lack of Longitudinal Studies: Existing studies primarily focus on short-term outcomes like certification rates. There's a need for longitudinal studies tracking graduates' career paths over several years to assess the long-term impact of the AWS Academy program on their employability.
- Qualitative Data Scarcity: Much of the existing data is quantitative. Further qualitative research (e.g., interviews with students, employers, and instructors) is crucial to understand the lived experiences and perspectives of stakeholders involved in the partnership.
- Comparative Analysis: A comparative analysis of the AWS Academy program with other similar initiatives is needed to determine its unique strengths and weaknesses.
- Scalability and Transferability:  Research on the scalability and transferability of the AWS Academy model to different contexts (e.g., different institutions, regions) is essential for broader impact.
 
4. Opportunities for Further Study:
 
The identified gaps suggest several avenues for future research:
 
- Longitudinal Study:  Conduct a longitudinal study tracking the career trajectories of AWS Academy graduates over a period of 5-10 years.
- Qualitative Case Study:  Conduct in-depth qualitative interviews with stakeholders to explore their experiences and perspectives.
- Comparative Analysis:  Compare the AWS Academy program with other industry-academia partnerships in the tech sector.
- Scalability and Transferability Study:  Investigate the factors that enable or hinder the scalability and transferability of the AWS Academy model.
 
5. Strengths and Weaknesses of the RRL:
 
Strengths:
 
- Comprehensive Coverage: The RRL covers a diverse range of relevant literature, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the field.
- Clear Relevance: The authors effectively connect each source to the research question, highlighting its relevance to the study.
- Strong Justification: The RRL provides a strong justification for the research, emphasizing the need to bridge the skills gap and explore the effectiveness of industry partnerships.
 
Weaknesses:
 
- Limited Depth: While the RRL covers various areas, it could benefit from more in-depth exploration of certain themes, like specific industry needs or the limitations of existing industry-academia partnerships.
- Lack of Critical Analysis:  The RRL largely summarizes existing research, with limited critical analysis of its strengths, weaknesses, or potential biases.
- Focus on Quantitative Data:  The RRL relies heavily on quantitative data. Integrating qualitative insights would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the complex factors influencing employability.
 
6. Conclusion:
 
This RRL provides a solid foundation for the research, demonstrating a good understanding of the existing literature on employability, industry-academia partnerships, and cloud computing. However, there are limitations in terms of depth, critical analysis, and reliance on quantitative data. Addressing these gaps through further research, particularly in the areas of longitudinal studies, qualitative data collection, comparative analysis, and scalability/transferability, would enhance the study's significance and contribute meaningfully to the field of education and employability in the technology sector.
